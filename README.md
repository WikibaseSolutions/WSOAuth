The **WSOAuth** extension enables you to delegate authentication to an OAuth provider. It provides a layer on top of PluggableAuth to allow authentication via a number of OAuth providers.

This extension requires PluggableAuth to be installed first. It also requires some PHP libraries, which may be installed using Composer.

Additional information about the extension and how to use it can be found on it's [MediaWiki page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WSOAuth).
